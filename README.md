Fun Times Portfolit

# Description
This project is a React-based portfolio designed to showcase the skills and projects of a web developer. As a single-page application (SPA), it features an intuitive user experience with seamless navigation between sections without reloading the page. This portfolio helps developers display their work samples, bio, resume, and contact information to potential employers, clients, and fellow developers. The app is built using React, and it will be deployed to Netlify.
